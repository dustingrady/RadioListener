# RadioListener
Realtime radio frequency detection using software defined radio (SDR)

Wanting to gain more experience with radio analysis, I wrote this simple script that will listen to specific frequencies, and report when they exceed a given threshold.
 
###### This could be useful for:
- Listening for keyless entry systems
- Listening for garage door remotes
- Learning more about RF!
 
###### Software:
 - All Python
 
###### Hardware: 
- I'm using a [NooElec R820T2SDR](https://www.nooelec.com/store/sdr/sdr-receivers/nesdr-mini-2.html)
